`hidey-bar` effect is another popular scroll linked effect. A typical implementation has 
a different effect depending on direction of scroll, down scroll to reveal, up move as if position 
is relative to the container. Once the finger is lifted the bar uses a time animation to animate
to its final state (hidden if more than half is hidden or shown otherwise).
